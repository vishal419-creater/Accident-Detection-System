# Accident-Detection-System
A real time accident detection system that can accurately and efficiently detect accidents in real time by analyzing sensor data from vehicles and surrounding environments in order to accurately differentiate between normal driving patterns and anomalous events indicating accidents.
It is implemented using machine learning algorithms to classify and detected accidents based on severity and type such as collisions, rollovers, or sudden stops.
